# Descryption
This project analyzes student performance data across four schools (A, B, C, D) for 200 students. It includes metrics such as attendance, subject scores (Math, Science, Engineering, Technology), and overall averages. The analysis covers:

1. Overall and school-wise performance comparisons

2. Gender-based score distributions

3. Attendance impact on academic results

4. Subject-level top performers

5. Data validation and cleaning processes

Tools used include SQL for querying and cleaning, R for visualization and statistical summaries, and Excel for initial data structuring and dashboard preparation. The goal is to identify trends, evaluate educational outcomes, and support data-informed decision-making in an academic context.
